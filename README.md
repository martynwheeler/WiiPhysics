Background
I recently discovered that you could communicate with Wii controllers such as the WiiMote and Balance Board using a PC thanks to Brian Peek's fantastic wiimotelib. This set me thinking about using them to demonstrate some Physics principles. As a result, I have developed this application that is capable of retrieving the data from a Wii controller in real time. The software is pretty basic but it has most of the features that I want built into it, I will gradually add more to it as I think of more ideas or receive suggestions from others that have used it. 

Further details of the physical principles and example applications can be found on my website. Feel free to contact me if you need further information.
